	  fping is a program to send ICMP echo probes to network hosts, similar to ping,
	  but much better performing when pinging multiple hosts. fping has a very
	  long history: Roland Schemers did publish a first version of it in 1992 and it has
	  established itself since then as a standard tool for network diagnostics and statistics.
