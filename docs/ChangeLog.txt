** Networking

-- openldap, added libraries and shell commands ldapsearch and ldapwhoami for LDAP client queries.  Added LDAP_* rc.conf
   variables to set the "LDAP Client System Defaults" via the "/etc/openldap/ldap.conf" system file.

-- network, unify network configuration to use ip (iproute2).  Users with custom /mnt/kd/rc.elocal and rc.local scripts
   performing network configuration are urged to make the similar changes (ifconfig, route -> ip), though not required.

-- ntpd, when NTPBROADCAST=yes clarify in the rc.conf comments that the IPv4 multicast only applies to the 1st LAN Interface.

-- ifplugd, new daemon added, when udhcpc is enabled (External Connection Type: DHCP) ifplugd monitors the ethernet
   link status and calls the udhcpc.action script to immediately (4-5 seconds) restart udhcpc when the link is back up.
   Note: The link must be down for at least 4-5 seconds before the script is called.
         Shorter durations are intentionally ignored.

-- AIF, add new "time-schedule-host-block" plugin. This selectively blocks outgoing connections by MAC or IP address based
   on a local time schedule and day-of-week.  Useful for blocking guest WiFi access during off-hours, children's curfew, etc. .

-- netsnmp, version bump to 5.7.2, change build options to enable Unix transport and agentx to support Asterisk's res_snmp.

-- OpenVPN, version bump to 2.3.2

-- Enable Asterisk res_snmp.so module when netsnmp is enabled (standard) used together with the snmpd service.
   Includes ASTERISK-MIB.txt and DIGIUM-MIB.txt mib files.
   More Info: http://doc.astlinux.org/userdoc:tt_asterisk_snmp_monitoring

-- Asterisk 11, fixed an issue when res_xmpp is active and unwanted debug log /tmp/refs grows without limit.
   More Info: https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-21785

-- Automatically add symlink /var/spool/asterisk/meetme -> /mnt/kd/monitor/meetme so recordings without MEETME_RECORDINGFILE
   defined will be saved on persistent storage, and located such that the Monitor tab may be used to manage them.

-- When the directory /mnt/kd/dictate exists, add symlink /var/spool/asterisk/dictate -> /mnt/kd/dictate so the
   dialplan Dictate() application files will be placed on persistent storage.

** Web Interface

-- ConfBridge tab, new ConfBridge tab has been added, hidden by default. Similar to the MeetMe tab.

-- Network tab, allow static IPv6 when DHCP is specified for IPv4 on external interface.

-- Prefs tab, allow "staff" user to access SQL-Data tab, disabled by default.

-- Network and Edit tabs, add "SNMP Agent Server" support for "/mnt/kd/snmp/snmpd.conf".
   Additionally, added "Restart SNMP Server" menu entries.

-- System tab, add the "/mnt/kd/snmp/" directory to the Basic Configuration Backup.

-- Network tab, added "LDAP Client System Defaults" support for LDAP_* rc.conf variables.
   Edit tab, added "LDAP Client System Defaults" support for optional /mnt/kd/ldap.conf file.
   Additionally, Network and Edit tabs, added "Reload LDAP Client" menu entries.

-- A new "phone-ldap-dir.php" cgi script, similar to the "phone-dir.php cgi script", but uses
   the "LDAP Client System Defaults" settings to query the data.  Only 'anonymous' queries are
   supported by the standard cgi script.
   Note: The Network tab "LDAP Server URI(s):" entry must be defined for this cgi script to be enabled.

Additions for AstLinux 1.1.0:
=============================

Released 2013-02-07

** IMPORTANT NOTICE

-- "via[-serial]" and "viac7[-serial]" board types will be automatically redirected to "geni586[-serial]"
   board types.  Since the release of AstLinux 1.x using a unified kernel config across all boards, the
   usefulness of special "via" and "viac7" board types has been eliminated.  Users do not have to do anything
   special, upgrading with "upgrade-run-image" or the web interface System tab is all that is required.

-- "net4801" and "wrap" board types have reached end-of-life.  AstLinux 1.0.6 was the last supported version.

     Usage: set-locale install xx_XX[.UTF-8] [locale_repository_url]
     Usage: set-locale list [locale_repository_url]
     Usage: set-locale remove|show

   Example: set-locale install de_DE

   Then, in /etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf, define:
   ==
   charset=UTF-8
   locale=de_DE.UTF-8
   ==
   Then Asterisk voicemail emails will contain dates/time in German.

-- ldate, new AstLinux specific 'date' command supporting UTF-8 locales installed via set-locale.
   Custom generated emails and such may use 'ldate' to provide a locale specific date string.

-- A console welcome message is now generated on startup, showing versions, interfaces, IP's, etc. .

   the directory "/mnt/kd/phoneprov/" exists.  Additionally, PCRE is now enabled in lighttpd.

-- AIF, version bump to 2.0.1d, new features including:
   == Added nat-loopback plugin for local nets using existing NAT_FORWARD_TCP and NAT_FORWARD_UDP rules.
   == Added outbound-snat plugin to support when a NAT'ed external interface has multiple IPv4 addresses, it may be
      desirable to specify which internal IP's or CIDR's use which external IPv4 addresses for outbound connections.

-- AIF, add new "openvpn-server" plugin. This now provides consistency for all three VPN types.
   This plugin behaves just like the "ipsec-vpn" and "pptp-vpn" plugins do, they are automatically
   enabled/disabled when the VPN service is enabled/disabed.  Additionally, the OpenVPN Server
   UDP/TCP and port number configuration is automatically used in the firewall rule.  By default, the
   equivalent of the Firewall sub-tab rule:  "Pass EXT->Local UDP 0/0 1194" is created by the openvpn-server
   plugin.  The default 0/0 (AnyHost) allowed external host can be overridden with the new web interface
   "Network -> OpenVPN Server -> Firewall Options: External Hosts:" field (or OVPN_TUNNEL_HOSTS variable).

   Note: If you previously restricted OpenVPN Server external hosts, be sure to define the External Hosts:
         field.  Additionally, any manual OpenVPN server related Firewall sub-tab rule(s) can be deleted.

   These different modes are selected with the opermode=N option set in /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf .
   Thanks to Frank Collingwood for the patch and info.
   More info: http://collingwood.me.uk/blog/index.php/adding-complex-impedance-support-to-an-x100p-fxo-card/

** Web Interface

-- Network tab, Firewall Plugins: list is now marked as:
   ==  [Active] if the plugin is currently active.
   ==  [Enabled] if the plugin will be active on next Restart Firewall.
   ==  [Disabled] if the plugin will not be active on next Restart Firewall.

-- Network tab, add support for the new PHONEPROV_ALLOW variable, under Network Services:

     HTTP & HTTPS /phoneprov/ Allowed IP's: __________ (10.1.2.* 2001:db8:1:*)

   More info: http://doc.astlinux.org/userdoc:tt_ip_phone_provisioning

-- Network tab, add new, Network Services: Asterisk SIP-TLS Server Certificate { SIP-TLS Certificate }
   This new sub-tab creates TLS certificates similar to what the Asterisk "ast_tls_cert" script does.
   After clicking { Create New }, the following Asterisk sip.conf settings will enable SIP-TLS support.
   == sip.conf ==
   tlsenable=yes
   tlsbindaddr=0.0.0.0
   tlscertfile=/mnt/kd/ssl/sip-tls/keys/server.crt

   IPv4 address will be NAT'ed by the rule.

   This feature allows multiple public IPv4 addresses to be individually NAT'ed to private internal
   addresses by port or range of ports.

   The default value, 0/0 (or empty), remains as previous, any packet arriving on the external
   interface will be NAT'ed by the rule.

Additions for AstLinux 1.0.0:
=============================

Released 2011-12-16

** IMPORTANT NOTICE

-- AstLinux 1.0 is a major upgrade from the previous 0.7 series.  Most notable is much newer:
   Linux Kernel, BusyBox and supporting packages.  In addition the C Library is generated
   via eglibc, which is binary compatable with other glibc executables.  Glibc compatibility
   adds support for binary addons, such as Digium's G.729 CODEC, among others.

-- Features no longer supported in AstLinux 1.0

   == Native Wireless (WiFi) is no longer supported.

   == mISDNv1, chan_misdn is no longer supported due to the newer kernel.

   == The astmanproxy package is no longer supported.

   == The sfdisk command removed and tftpd now supported via dnsmasq.

-- The RUNNIX bootloader, version 0.4 is required.  The easiest is to start fresh with an AstLinux 1.0
   flash image, containing both the new RUNNIX bootloader and AstLinux 1.0 core.  In addition users
   may upgrade existing systems with both runnix-0.4 and Astlinux 1.0, see documentation.

-- Buildroot 2011-08 and Crosstool-NG 1.12.3 are the foundation of the AstLinux 1.0 build platform.

   A new rc.conf variable, ALERT_SOUNDS allows sounds to be generated for startup and/or
   shutdown for geni586 and geni586-serial boards.

** Networking

-- shellinaboxd, revision 239, added to provide CLI (Command Line Interface) 'login'
   via a web browser using "https://pbx/admin/cli/" and a new CLI tab in the web
   interface.  This feature is disabled by default.

==============================

Released 2011-10-23

** System

-- Add "shutdown" command to call Busybox reboot and poweroff commands.

-- apcupsd, version 3.14.9, a daemon for APC UPS's, supporting monitoring and powerfail shutdown.
   USB, ethernet and serial cables are supported.  The configuration will be auto-generated using
   the variables UPSTYPE, UPSCABLE and UPSDEVICE. If the file "/mnt/kd/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf" exists
   it will be used as a manual configuration.  Read-only supporting scripts are localed in the
   "/stat/etc/apcupsd/" directory, but may be superseded by custom scripts located in the
   "/mnt/kd/apcupsd/" directory.

   Email alerts will be sent if UPS_NOTIFY contains one or more email addresses. UPS_NOTIFY_FROM
   may be optionally set to define the From: email header.

-- php, major version bump to 5.3.8, including the same modules as in previous versions.

-- bridge-utils, (brctl) version bump to 1.5, added hairpin support.

** Networking

-- sshd, fixed an issue when both a persistent /root (ie. "/mnt/kd/root/" directory exists) and
   the "/mnt/kd/ssh_keys/" directory exists.  The "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys" file no longer gets
   appended with the "/mnt/kd/ssh_keys/" if "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys" already exists.

-- sshd, add support for root user keys, which permits publickey authentication for outbound
   ssh sessions as user 'root'.  The directory "/mnt/kd/ssh_root_keys/" is automatically
   created and populated with id_dsa and id_ecdsa public/private keys.  These keys are
   automatically copied to the "/root/.ssh/" directory if they don't already exist.

-- pppoe, add "/usr/sbin/pppoe-restart" script called by the web interface or manually via cron
   if necessary.  A new variable, PPPOE_RESTART_DELAY is supported.

** Web Interface

-- Add support for APC UPS Monitoring and Shutdown.  The Status tab displays info and recent
   UPS events.  The Prefs tab may hide the Status tab section if desired.  The Network tab
   adds a "APC UPS Monitoring & Shutdown" section to configure options.  If the file
   "/mnt/kd/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf" exists a { UPS Configuration } button will be displayed
   instead to manually edit the configuration.

   Email notifications will be sent if "Notify Email Addresses To:" is defined with one
   or more email addresses.  "Notify Email Address From:" is optional.

   Note: A USB configuration requires an empty "Device:" field.

-- Network and Edit tabs, add "Restart UPS Daemon" in the Restart menu.

-- Edit tab adds support for editing "/etc/asterisk/includes/*.conf" files.

-- System tab, include the "/mnt/kd/ssh_keys/" directory (containing public ssh keys automatically
   added to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys) in a Basic Configuration Backup and Restore.

   adds a new feature of automatically propagating certain KCMD options.  In particular,
   KCMD options: noram, rootdelay=, and reboot= are added to the new os/astlinux-xxxx.run.conf
   file on upgrades if the option(s) existed in the previous os/astlinux-xxxx.run.conf file.

** ADDENDUM **

   The AstLinux bootloader, RUNNIX, has been updated to runnix-0.3.2, previously runnix-0.2.1. This is
   considered an 'optional' upgrade at this time, and AstLinux 0.7.5 does not require runnix-0.3.2.

   If you currently have problems booting with a SATA drive, or just want the latest features, after
   you upgrade to 0.7.5, and with internet connectivity, you may upgrade RUNNIX from the CLI by typing:

   $ upgrade-RUNNIX-image check     (if the response looks good, then type)

   $ upgrade-RUNNIX-image upgrade   (patiently wait, do not interrupt)

   After a reboot, you will see the text below, you have 5 seconds to type a character, otherwise the normal
   boot will automatically proceed.

   quality and more commonly supported .wav (PCM) file will be played.
   Additionally, the Prefs tab adds support for the inline HTML5 <audio ...></audio> tag.

-- Added small, transparent AstLinux logo to all pages.
   Custom branding can be achieved by replacing the logo in common/logo-small.gif
   which must be width="113" height="23", or it will be scaled to that.
   Custom GIF's with white backgrounds should be made transparent for best results.

** Web Interface

-- System tab adds the "Asterisk Sounds Packages" section where sounds and moh sound packages
   may be upgraded/installed or removed.  The Sounds Pkg URL used to retrieve the files
   can be defined in the Prefs tab.  The script "upgrade-asterisk-sounds" is used to do the work.


Additions for AstLinux 0.7.0:
=============================

Released 2010-01-18

** System

-- dialproxy.php script added. The purpose is to trigger a call by first dialing a selected
   extension, when answered, the script completes and an outgoing call is initiated to the num=
   number. The actionlist "DIALPROXY-value" key is used to define the extension and options.

   A call could be triggered by any application which can call an URL, for example:
   $ curl --insecure "https://pbx/dialproxy.php?num=2223334444&ext=value"

   The actionlist "DIALPROXY-value" key provides the security to limit access, disabled by default.

   and Whitelist:NUM links to the respective tabs.

-- Added Actionlist Tab. The asterisk astdb database is used with family "actionlist".
   'admin' and 'staff' users can access the Actionlist tab. The Actionlist tab is a more
   general variation of the Blacklist and Whitelist tabs, requiring
   asterisk support via the extensions.conf dialplan.

-- CDR Log tab has been redesigned to support multiple 'pages' that can easily be viewed.
   The number of most recent CDR records to view and page size can be defined.
   Currently up to 5000 records may be viewed, 5x greater than previously.

-- The OpenVPN server credentials adds a README.txt file documenting the credential files.
   The automatically generated password to the PKCS#12 file is contained in the README.txt file.

-- Network tab adds support for Dynamic DNS "DNS Get IP Address". AstLinux 0.7 uses a patched
   version of inadyn that optionally supports obtaining the public IP address from the external
   interface. The default method remains querying getip.krisk.org .

-- The "ZoneEdit [generic]" has been removed since it is no longer required to work around
   an inadyn problem. The ZoneEdit item should work for all ZoneEdit users.

-- The Edit tab now groups the editable files in three sections, System Configuration,
   Asterisk Configuration and Firewall Plugins.  More system files are editable.

-- The Network tab now supports the Arno firewall with a single, external interface. The firewall
   can now be enabled or disabled, regardless of the number of internal interfaces.

-- Network tab now supports the selection of either [DNS & DHCP] or [DNS only] for each
   internal network. This applies to internal networks with interfaces defined.

-- The System tab has a new option "Restore Basic Configuration". Any Backup download that
   is 8 MBytes or smaller can be used to restore the configuration of basic settings.

-- A new OpenVPN Client sub-tab has been added to the Network tab. Both OpenVPN client and server
   are now fully supported in the web interface.

-- General layout changes and improvements.
